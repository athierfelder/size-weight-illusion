# size-weight-illusion

This repository contains the Unity project developed at the Human Movement Science Lab at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. The application was developed for the Microsoft HoloLens using Unity (Version 2017.4.13) and the integration of the Vuforia Engine for image tracking. 

The sizeâ€“weight illusion (SWI) describes the experience that small objects feel heavier than equally-weighted larger objects. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether the SWI can be manipulated by augmenting the apparent size of the stimuli with holographic size stimuli. 

In this study, two physical cubes of unequal volume were used, i.e. a _small cube_ and a _large cube_. The manipulation consisted of a _holographic cube_ of the same size as the _large cube_ that was projected on top of the physical cubes. In both cases, the physical cubes were visible below the _holographic cube_. Subjects had to lift both cubes in several trials and rate their heaviness indicating a self-chosen number. Additionally, the fingertip forces were measured.

In order to overlay the physical cubes with the holographic cube, trackable images inspired by QR-codes were placed on the front side of the cubes as input for the Vuforia Engine.
