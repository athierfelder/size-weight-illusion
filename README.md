# size-weight-illusion

Project Code accompanying a study conducted at the Chair of Human Movement Science at the Technical University of Munich.

The goal of the study underlying this code was to investigate whether assistive cues delivered by the HoloLens can alter the weight prediction of a cube in a size-weight illusion experiment.

This repository documents the development of the application on the HoloLens which gave the assistive cues. The application was developed in Unity (version 2017.4.13). The real cubes were tracked using image tracking provided by the Vuforia Engine, and the virtual cubes were laid over the real cube using the tracked position of the real cube.
