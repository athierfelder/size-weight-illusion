# size-weight-illusion

This repository contains the Unity project developed at the Human Movement Science Lab at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. The application was developed for the Microsoft Hololens using Unity (Version 2017.4.13) and the integration of the Vuforia Engine for image tracking. 

The sizeâ€“weight illusion describes how small objects feel heavier than large objects while they actually have the same mass. This illusion is generally a stable perceptual illusion, even if the subject is told that the cubes have the same mass. The experiment conducted here determines whether the phenomenon of the size-weight illusion can be manipulated by holographic size stimuli.

In this study, two physical cubes of unequal size were used, i.e. a _small cube_ and a _large cube_. The manipulation consisted of a _holographic cube_ of the same size as the _large cube_ that was projected on top of the physical cubes. In both cases, the physical cubes were visible below the _holographic cube_. The subjects then had to rate the perceived _heaviness_ of the cubes in several trials. 

In order to overlay the physical cubes with the holographic cube, trackable images inspired by QR-codes were placed on the front side of the cubes as input for the Vuforia Engine.
